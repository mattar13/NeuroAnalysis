# PhysiologyAnalysis.jl

## STABLE BRANCH

This is the stable branch of the ePhys.jl file. Here only things that consistently work will be added and very rarely will this version be updated. 

Once the interface is more developed this will not be updated for a while

## Tutorial for using the interface

#### 1) Using the trace analysis

```
using ePhys
using Pluto
run_
```
